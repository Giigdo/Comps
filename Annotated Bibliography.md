[https://ocul-yor.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_YOR/j50f41/cdi_proquest_miscellaneous_56500304](https://ocul-yor.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_YOR/j50f41/cdi_proquest_miscellaneous_56500304)**

Acording to Akrich, a technical object is an expression or nexus of many phenomena. It is both the result of social influences and a social influencer. The complexitiy of the design process and building process as well as the collection of raw materials can reach far beyond the specific instance of the technology itself.  They argue the de-scription of an object involves a revalation of the relationship that exists between design projects and the actual environment that it is injected into. Importantly they point out that technical objects build “heterogenous networks that bring together actants of all types and sizes, whether human or nonhuman”.  Akrich looks at the changes that technical objects undergo as they transfer from the dominat society they were intended to serve as they move into posession  of under-developed communities. This mindset could be viewed as useful in examining how technolgoy is adopted differently in Indigenous socieity and when thinking about digital media in Anishinaabe instances how the understanding of cross species impact is a key concept of relationality that is fundamental to that society. This discussion is important when considering how we might use tools that have been developed as games (entertainment) or educational and how we might make use of them for projects of resurgence and survival even though they were designed for different communities and purposes.

Bardzell argues that pluralism is important in HCI and ICT studies. They hold that other points of view are needed to better inform ICT and HCI scholarship which is highly influenced by a dominant eurocentric and male point of view that portents the possibility of a generalizable human computer interaction. Bardzell argures that “Feminism is a natural ally to interaction design, due to its central commitments to issues such as agency, fulfillment, identity, equity, empowerment, and social justice.” This alternate lens creates space for understanding the importance of context in relation to human and computer relations. Bardzell states it isn’t enough to use “empirical research” which supports the status quo. Designers instead need to take a stance of advocacy to ensure that marginalized communities are able to reap benefit from development.

Educational Technology Research Patterns in the Realm of the Digital Knowledge Age maps how EdTech scholarship has evolved since the early 1990s: publications surged after 1993; social sciences dominate the field, with computer science and engineering trailing; and research themes shifted by era—from multimedia and instructional design (1993–1999), to convergence with distance/online learning and school integration (2000–2004), to curriculum revision and higher-ed focus (2005–2009), to ICT integration and online learning’s “full potential” (2010–2014), and finally to data-driven “smart” EdTech, big data, and learning analytics (2015–2019). The review flags recurring hype cycles (innovative tech as “the next best thing” that may even replace teachers), overreliance on positivist “does it work?” studies, Western bias (calling for pluralistic, international, and interdisciplinary work), and a late but growing concern with ethics and equity.

The article is highly critical of edu-tech systems that are focused on tracking and using student data to inform educational goals and learning managment. Buchannan and McPherson note these highly data-driven systems interfer with personalized student learning and limit teachers’ in meeting their students needs. The large quantities of data that are now available lead to deeper systems of control, which they argue are creating new mesaures of success for students to conform to. These systems also turn education into a profit generating enterprise which changes the focus from individual learning to generalized reaching of benchmarks set and maintained by private interests. They argue that because these systems minimize the need for teachers and one to one contact they will impoverish the personalized support inherent in human interaction.

The authors view data collection of data as an extractive process tied to historical colonialism and other forms of extraction. They note that “data relations … give corporations a comprehensive view” of lives and create a new resource for exploitation. They point out that interactions between individuals are being commodified and the current movement into private lives is unprecedented in its potential for the generation of new captial. They view this expansion as highly problematic as it turns lived experience into wealth for sombody else. They argue that the digital divide is really about who is able to put data to work and define its value. They see the current datafication of relations as generating wealth for others by exploting the efforts of others. This is of particular interest for educators and community who are making choices regarding edu-tech solutions that can lead to rapid wealth generation for corporations. These ideas point to a need to develop community based platforms to ensure wealth remains with those who create it.

DiSalvo theorizes “adversarial design” as political design that stages contestation (agonism) through artifacts, systems, and computational media. Distinguishing “design for politics” from “political design,” he outlines tactics—revealing hegemony, reconfiguring the remainder, and articulating agonistic collectives—and shows how designed things shape beliefs and actions by making alternatives experientially tangible. Examples span info visualizations, social robots, and ubicomp, emphasizing ongoing dissensus rather than consensus-building. See your highlights on the definition and scope of adversarial design and agonism framing, its distinction from design for politics, and tactics and exemplars that “shift debate from discursive to experiential” practice: the book’s core definition of adversarial design, the political vs. politics distinction, the tactics across a practice continuum, and the role of computation in political expression.

The authors take up a discussion of how dominant western and male points of view are deeply embedded in Information and Computer Technology (ICT) studies. They argue that Indigenous feminist approaches are a viable alternative that speaks back against colonialism. They note that networks can be places of harm for Indigenous people however, they also point to examples of where the web and its tools have been used by Indigenous people in positive ways to maintain community. The authors demonstrate how relatedness and relationships are key to Indigenous research and community based work and that connection to community is a key part of Indigenous ICT which, is distinct from dominant uses of the internet. In particular, Indigenous people were found to be concerned with issues of social justice and environmental sustainability instead of the more common political discourse of the mainstream discussion. This distinction has led to them being forced to explain the alternate methods to traditional audiences involved in data and computer science including demonstrating rigor in their relational process even though it is accepted in other discipines and has been shown to be more rigorous than the western “objective” process because it must be vetted through community.

**Gerjets, P. H., & Hesse, F. W. (2004). When are powerful learning environments effective? The role of learner activities and of students’ conceptions of educational technology. _International Journal of Educational Research_, _41_(6), 445–465. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijer.2005.08.011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijer.2005.08.011)**

Gerjets and Hesse examine when technology-based “powerful learning environments” are effective, arguing that effectiveness hinges less on media itself and more on the learning activities it affords and elicits. Drawing on constructivist traditions, they define powerful environments as those aligning with knowledge construction over transmission, competencies over declarative facts, and social exchange over individual learning, emphasizing activities that are constructive and cumulative, authentic and understanding-based, cooperative, and self-controlled and goal-oriented (constructivist framing and activity criteria; activity characteristics). They propose combining constructivist and cognitive perspectives to predict which activities in tech-based contexts help or hinder learning (integrative framework). Two constraints are central: environments must at least afford effective activities, and learners must actually engage in them (affordances and engagement; specifying conditions for engagement). Because small differences in activities can flip effects, designs based on general “powerful learning” principles can inadvertently promote harmful strategies, and media–learning links are at best indirect via activities (small differences, potential harm; indirect media–learning link). The authors also note limited education research on how conceptions shape activities, urging attention to findings from adjacent fields (research gap and cross-field insights).

Brave New Platforms argues that as schooling becomes decentralized and marketized, commercial digital platforms can reshape education through data extraction and adaptive AI. Using speculative scenarios, Hillman, Bergviken Rensfeldt, and Ivarsson outline three stages: (1) platforms enter via administration, then content/assessment, becoming de facto curricula; (2) states outsource “essential” services while platforms profit from user data; (3) adaptive platforms steer groups and labor-force readiness, colonizing values and aspirations. They warn this shift risks replacing democratically negotiated curricular purposes with algorithmic, corporate logics, raising concerns about data colonialism, governance, student vulnerability, and the erosion of public education’s social and civic missions.

[https://doi.org/10.1080/17439884.2023.2219900](https://doi.org/10.1080/17439884.2023.2219900)**

Digital learning is redrawing who learns, where, and how, by expanding and sometimes dissolving traditional boundaries of schooling. However, it remains anchored in standard “classificatory logics” that sort learners and define fair knowledge and assessment. The core tension is that AI/EdTech often promises life-long, life-wide flexibility and learner-led pathways, but its devices and tests still enact industrial, standardized sorting that can reproduce inequalities and biased, self-fulfilling trajectories. Classification operates as a shared infrastructure that connects pedagogy and technology, translating moral and epistemic orders of “good and fair education” into categories and algorithms that flag risks, recommend content, and group students. The paper looks at how conventions, tests, and situations to reveal how school-world narratives (industrial vs. inspired) interlock within concrete learning experiences to produce real social consequences. This approach explains why heterogeneous EdTech assumptions persist and clarifies how changing learning boundaries intersect with social classification to empower some learners while disadvantaging others.

**Ingold, T. (n.d.). _Research Statement_. Tim Ingold. Retrieved November 1, 2024, from [https://www.timingold.com/research-statement](https://www.timingold.com/research-statement)**

Tim Ingold’s research statement traces a shift from classic ethnography toward a relational, ecological anthropology deeply resonant with Indigenous thought. Drawing on ecological psychology (Gibson) and developmental systems theory (Oyama), he rejects culture-as-representation in favor of knowing-in-action, emphasizing humans as becomings (“to human is a verb”) entangled in social and ecological relations. His reanalysis of Hallowell’s Ojibwe ontology and work on walking, making, and “following the materials” foreground place, storytelling, and improvisatory ways of life, aligning with Indigenous emphases on relationality, land-based knowledge, and practice over abstraction. While not framed as community-collaborative Indigenous research, his approach consistently engages Indigenous scholarship and ontologies to unsettle human/nature and culture/technology bifurcations and to argue for a developmental, situated understanding of life and knowledge.

**Jelewska, A. (2024). Postdigital Collective Memory: Media Practices Against Total Design. _Postdigital Science and Education_, _6_(1), 259–278. [https://doi.org/10.1007/s42438-023-00421-9](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42438-023-00421-9)**

Jelewska introduces “postdigital collective memory” as a critical design approach to remembering places shaped by violence and total design—Tony Fry’s term for long-term, systemic, often colonial, anthropocentric redesign of landscapes and societies. Grounded in a postdigital, posthumanist paradigm, the article reframes digital media as designed objects that co-create knowledge and memory with human and nonhuman actants. Through Critical Media Design methods and workshops at Lake Elsensee-Rusałka, the team developed media diagrams and a prototype “Sensitive Data Lake” to surface suppressed histories, counter top-down platforms like Google Maps, and model transitional, community-led world-making. Emphasizing prototyping, situated comprehension, and small-scale interventions, the work positions design as an engaged, ethical practice capable of transforming epistemic modes and sharing memory without imposing new monuments—opening research pathways for postdigital science, education, and ecopedagogies.

This textbook frames HCI’s “ways of knowing” through complementary approaches, especially RtD and GTM. RtD treats making as inquiry, generating knowledge through iterative selecting–designing–evaluating–reflecting–repeating, suited to wicked, multi-stakeholder problems and to designers’ situated knowledge in practices and artifacts. GTM, by contrast, begins with data and builds theory through iterative coding, constant comparison, making memos, and theoretical sampling until categories and the emerging substantive theory are saturated and accountable to the data. The book also clarifies how interviews and observations commonly pair with GTM due to shared commitments, and offers criteria—fit, relevance, workability, modifiability—for judging GTM outcomes and improving evaluative processes in HCI reporting. Overall, it positions classical theory-testing alongside practical-deliberative and critical-emancipatory stances, emphasizing epistemological accountability while legitimizing design-led knowledge and grounded theorizing as robust routes to understanding people, contexts, and sociotechnical change in HCI.

Beyond the Flipped Classroom: A Highly Interactive Cloud-Classroom (HIC) Embedded into Basic Materials Science Courses. _Journal of Science Education and Technology_, _25_(3), 460–473. [https://doi.org/10.1007/s10956-016-9606-8](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10956-016-9606-8)**

Beyond the flipped classroom looks at a highly interactive cloud-classroom (HIC) embedded into basic materials science courses. This study extends flipped learning by integrating a device-agnostic, HTML5 cloud-classroom with AR/VR modules to create highly interactive pre-class and in-class experiences. The HIC model shifts instructors from “sage on the stage” to “guide on the side,” improving posttest and delayed-test performance across knowledge, comprehension, and application. It emphasizes multi-representational content, real-time interaction, and formative assessment, aligning with calls to augment flipped classrooms with technologies beyond video. See the definition of flipped learning and the HIC outcomes in the author’s highlights on the flipped model and interactive learning gains, the teacher role shift, and tech integration beyond video.

Cruel optimism in edtech: When the digital data practices of educational technology providers inadvertently hinder educational equity. _Learning, Media and Technology_, _44_(1), 77–86. [https://doi.org/10.1080/17439884.2018.1556217](https://doi.org/10.1080/17439884.2018.1556217)**

Cruel optimism in edtech describes how hopeful attachments to “innovative” tools promise transformation yet often entrench old problems or create new harms. The authors show a field captivated by technological determinism and “blind faith” that the next tool will save education or even replace teachers, despite a long record of failures and hype cycles that ignore history and context. They show how in many circumstances, optimism becomes policy and practice, prescribing “more data” and progress while narrowing purposes and reducing pedagogy to behavior management and prediction. Platformization and adaptive systems risk privatizing curricular values and amplifying bias, sorting students. Alternatives emphasize educational wisdom, community ownership, critical pedagogy, and iterative accountability rather than faith in tools alone, valuing teachers’ judgment and community-driven, critical approaches to education.

Macgilchrist argues that being “critical” in edtech means interrogating the assumptions built into proposed solutions rather than asking what works. Critical studies unsettle common-sense by exposing how pedagogical and technical fixes can reproduce exclusion, and by examining power, bias, and representation in sociotechnical systems. She highlights speculative and generative approaches—restorying and imagining “other” futures—as equity work that both critiques the present and orients self- and worldmaking within oppressive systems. Examples such as AR overlays that surface overlooked women, or feminist design of chatbots, demonstrate how media can reveal and reconfigure hegemonic narratives and infrastructures. Criticality thus extends beyond tool use to the design of futures and the conditions of knowledge production, inviting readers to question whose values are embedded, who benefits, and what alternatives are possible. In short, critical edtech troubles inherited convictions, shifts attention from optimization to transformation, and mobilizes imaginative practices to denaturalize and redesign education’s sociotechnical orders.

Plantin and Punathambekar argue that dominant internet companies have grown from “platforms” into “infrastructure,” becoming indispensable systems that organize communication, culture, and markets. Studying this shift requires an integrated lens that links technical “pipes” (cables, data centers, protocols) and social practices (labor, maintenance, governance, culture). Platforms are “generative” (they enable unpredictable user creations), depend on user “participation” (content and data traces), and achieve scale through “modularity” (a stable core plus interchangeable add-ons), which helps them mesh with or replace existing infrastructures. This infrastructuralization redistributes power, deciding who is inside or outside essential services, and reveals inequalities in access (e.g., video streaming) and risks when a single platform dominates a public sphere (as with Facebook in Myanmar). The authors call for historically grounded analysis of the ideological work behind assembling and maintaining these hybrid systems.

**Savin-Baden, M., & Tombs, G. (2017). _Research methods for education in the digital age_. Bloomsbury Academic, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc.**

Research Methods for Education in the Digital Age argues that digital scholarship demands clear alignment between paradigm, methodology, and methods to avoid incoherence in data collection and interpretation. It contrasts positivism, post-positivism, pragmatism, and phenomenology, urging researchers to position themselves reflexively and ensure validity in contextually contingent studies. The book highlights emergent and “liquid” methodologies suited to hybrid, digitized spaces, including visual methods, narrative inquiry, cyber ethnography, and digital métissage that braid co-produced stories across media and cultures. In the context of the book " liquid methodologies … suggest that engaging with a world of liquid uncertainties might bring to light new understandings in terms of new notions of methodology and methods, as well as different understandings of space and spatial practices, and a recognition that research spaces are increasingly hybridized, extended and mixed." It situates design-based research as iterative, collaborative, and context-bound, while critiquing tech-centric and data maximization assumptions in learning analytics. It argues for a careful selection of methods and ethical scrutiny of big data claims.

The article argues that contemporary EdTech embeds “pre-emption,” an automated governance mode that uses past data to steer present actions toward a predefined future, making the future an event to be acted on now. Rather than merely predicting possibilities, pre-emption sets conditions and intervenes to realize a desired outcome, often via nudges and recommender systems that normalize risk anticipation and efficiency in digital education governance. This relies on frameless data capture and exhaust data (mouse movements, response times, gaze), producing datafied students while excluding situated context, agency, interiority, and culture. Educational knowledge becomes pattern-based and proprietary, with process data rarely linked to outcomes, yet positioned as authoritative and unfalsifiable. Such configurations render students as if physically absent, enable pre-emptive judgments of success/failure, and remove alternative futures by reinforcing a singular version of success. The paper concludes that pre-emptive EdTech configuration is detrimental to students, because it governs by exclusion and makes itself always “right” through its interventions.

Absolon and Willett argue for an Indigenous-led research paradigm that rejects Euro-western claims to neutrality and superiority, insisting on historical contextualization, cultural protocols, and community control throughout the research process. They stress that researchers—Indigenous and non-Indigenous—must embed a critical analysis of colonialism in their methodologies and engage communities so methods reflect Aboriginal perspectives. Renewal requires strength grounded in identity, community, and governance, with knowledge understood as being, living, and doing, not detached abstraction. Euro-western positivism distorts Indigenous realities and undermines self-determination, whereas Indigenous approaches are holistic, relational, and action-oriented toward liberation and community benefit. The work foregrounds responsibilities for access to technical knowledge and ownership to “construct our own reality,” advocate methods like learning/sharing circles, and caution that writing fixes dynamic knowledge. They also critique academia’s resistance to Aboriginal scholarship and urge focusing on specific, context-rooted areas of theory and practice that move beyond library research to current lived realities. Key passages: colonial critique, community ownership, and relational, protocol-driven methods. See, for example, the calls for community-engaged methodology and Indigenous control and the critique of Euro-western gatekeeping.

Byrne argues that Indigenous-created video games can serve as “read-only sacred spaces” that protect cultural knowledge from appropriation or damage while providing safe environments for identity exploration. She defines sacred spaces through three criteria: they defy scientific quantification, maintain controlled access, and are designated as sacred by their creators or communities. Byrne contends that the digital realm naturally fulfills these requirements, as video games exist beyond physical limitations and can be replicated without harming the original. Central to her argument is the “triad of self, community, and land” as inseparable elements of Indigenous sacred understanding, which Western philosophy typically fragments. She advocates for Indigenous creators to develop works using “secret languages” accessible primarily to community members, avoiding “pain-tourism” by outsiders. Through her own game development experience, Byrne demonstrates how simple mechanics can explore complex emotional and cultural reconnection processes, positioning Indigenous-centered gaming as both cultural preservation tool and decolonial resistance practice.

**Duarte, M. E. (2017). _Network sovereignty: Building the Internet across Indian Country_. University of Washington.**

Duarte examines how Indigenous communities strategically build broadband infrastructure to assert tribal sovereignty and resist colonization. She introduces “reframing” as a decolonizing methodology that centers Indigenous experiences rather than viewing limited Internet access as an “Indian problem.” Through case studies of tribal ICT projects like TDVnet, K-Net, and the Lakota Network, Duarte demonstrates how Native leaders use community needs assessments, pilot projects, and iterative development to create locally-controlled digital infrastructures. She argues that tribal broadband networks serve cultural sovereignty by enabling intergenerational knowledge transmission, language revitalization, and self-governance while challenging colonial information systems designed to subjugate Indigenous ways of knowing. Duarte critiques mainstream technology deployment that ignores tribal sovereignty and colonial legacies, advocating instead for Indigenous-led approaches that integrate traditional values with digital connectivity. Her work reveals how Native peoples conscript ICTs for decolonization, transforming technologies of domination into tools for cultural preservation and political resistance.

[https://doi.org/10.1111/bjet.12963](https://doi.org/10.1111/bjet.12963)**

Decolonizing Posthumanism argues that mainstream posthumanism and new materialism often lean on quantum epistemology metaphors—especially “entanglement”—that flatten context and re-center Western science, as critiqued in the discussion of recurring quantum epistemology tropes of entanglement. In contrast, the authors propose Indigenous material agency as a fuller account of human–nonhuman relations and a better fit with decolonial aims. Through a generative STEM framework, they collaborate with African, South American, African American, and Native American communities, showing significant gains in STEM interest and understanding while avoiding content-agnostic constructivism. Case studies—from trickster-informed biodiversity pedagogy to wood-bending traditions integrating geometric, organic, and mechanical properties—demonstrate how Indigenous knowledge grounds technical learning without appropriation. Crucially, Indigenous economies aim at value circulation rather than extraction, reshaping what counts as progress in STEM. The authors caution against replacing authentic Indigenous frameworks with quantum physics as an explanatory shortcut, a move that can become a research dead end and feed “plastic shaman” appropriations. Instead, Indigenous-led collaborations open richer, just pathways for STEM.

[https://doi.org/10.24908/pceea.2024.18621](https://doi.org/10.24908/pceea.2024.18621)**

Forrest, Alves, and Cicek address the absence of Indigenous research methodologies in engineering education research (EER) by documenting their experience using Indigenous approaches to study an Indigenous engineering access program. They employed critical reflexivity, Indigenous Métissage, and the four R’s (Respect, Relevance, Reciprocity, Responsibility) to examine participants’ experiences while navigating the complexities of being both community member and researcher. The authors argue that Indigenous methodologies, grounded in relationality and constructivist paradigms, offer valuable perspectives for EER despite having no precedent in the field. Through self-interviews, reflexive memos, and ethical relationality principles, they demonstrate how Indigenous methodologies can provide culturally sensitive approaches while producing meaningful findings. Their work reveals the challenges of conducting decolonial research within Western institutional frameworks, including limited relevant literature and methodological inexperience. The study serves as a methodological bridge for future Indigenous EER researchers, showing how traditional Indigenous approaches can generate new insights about engineering education while maintaining cultural integrity and community accountability.

Goodchild emphasizes that Western science often seeks understanding through fragmentation, while Elders pursue “wisdom-in-action” grounded in relationships and context, not isolation or abstraction. In Anishinaabemowin, a “system” is better understood as a verb which is dynamic, spirited, and always in relation, opposed to a static noun, highlighting an animate worldview. The article also engages Cree scholar Willie Ermine’s insight about the enduring schism between Indigenous and Western worldviews and proposes “ethical space” as a relational framework for creating new relationships premised on connection, love, and reciprocity. Together, these ideas call for a synthesis that centers place, kinship, and responsibilities (much like the ideas presented by Simpson, Duarte and Wemigwans) reframing systems as living relations, and opening shared ethical spaces where multiple knowledge systems can co-exist and co-create with humility and respect.

Hausknecht and colleagues examine a community-based participatory research project that used digital storytelling to foster intergenerational knowledge sharing between Elders and students in the Nak’azdli Whut’en First Nation. The study implemented a four-phase digital storytelling process involving cultural connections, story sharing, digital creation, and community publication to address cultural knowledge preservation needs following residential school impacts. Through focus groups and interviews, researchers found that the project successfully built relationships between Elders and students while creating a sense of accomplishment and pride in learning. Students learned traditional knowledge about medicine, legends, and personal histories while developing digital literacy skills. Challenges included scheduling coordination, time restrictions due to weather, and additional workload for teachers. The study demonstrates how digital storytelling can serve as both educational tool and cultural preservation method, with stories remaining community property under OCAP principles. The research suggests future iterations should allow students to practice with their own stories before working with Elder narratives.

Henry explores Indigenous Futurisms as a framework for reimagining science fiction and technology from Indigenous perspectives, building on Grace Dillon’s early 2000s work and drawing connections to Afrofuturism. The author examines how Indigenous creators use video games like Thunderbird Strike and Never Alone to challenge colonial narratives and center Indigenous worldviews, relationships, and caretaking responsibilities. Henry emphasizes that Indigenous Futurisms operates on a “hyperpresent now” philosophy, considering seven generations before and after, which collapses linear Western time concepts. The framework rejects colonial space exploration tropes, instead envisioning technological advancement that maintains ecological balance and honors Indigenous traditions. Through analysis of games and digital media, Henry demonstrates how Indigenous creators are defining themselves beyond colonial responses, creating works that celebrate community connection, land sharing, and environmental protection. The article positions Indigenous Futurisms as both creative resistance and autonomous world-building, offering alternative visions where technology serves Indigenous values rather than perpetuating colonial disruption.Retry

**LaPensée, E. (2021). When Rivers Were Trails: Cultural expression in an indigenous video game. _International Journal of Heritage Studies_** **_: IJHS_, _27_(3), 281–295.**

LaPensée examines the collaborative development of “When Rivers Were Trails” (WRWT), an educational game that challenges colonial narratives like “The Oregon Trail” by centering Indigenous perspectives on westward expansion and allotment policies. The game was developed through community-oriented processes involving Indigenous and non-Indigenous collaborators, with Anishinaabe worldview informing both mechanics and methodology. LaPensée analyzes how the project maintained Indigenous self-determination during collaborative development while appealing to middle and high school audiences as part of educational curriculum. The study incorporates close reading of 110 scenarios and companion stories written primarily by Indigenous contributors with diverse backgrounds, many new to game writing. WRWT represents the growing body of self-determined Indigenous games that express cultural uniqueness while addressing shared colonial experiences. The research demonstrates models for reciprocity-oriented collaboration and capacity building, offering insights for future Indigenous game development while honoring the difficult emotional labor of processing historical trauma through interactive storytelling.

Lewis and colleagues challenge anthropocentric approaches to AI ethics by proposing Indigenous epistemologies that accommodate non-human entities within kinship networks. They critique Joi Ito’s “Resisting Reduction” manifesto for centering human flourishing while arguing for reciprocal relationships with AI entities as potential kin rather than tools or slaves. The authors emphasize that Indigenous worldviews prioritize relationality over abstraction, grounding knowledge in territorial context and rejecting Western “epistemologies of control” that enable exploitation. They explore concepts like Hawaiian ʻĀIna (treating AI as nourishing land) and suggest developing programming languages grounded in Indigenous cultural frameworks like nēhiyaw nisitohtamowin. The work acknowledges community resistance to AI inclusion, noting concerns about AI’s colonial capitalist origins and potential for perpetuating exploitation. However, the authors advocate for imagining AI relationships “based not on fear but on love,” emphasizing that assumptions embedded in AI development will fundamentally shape future interactions for decades.

Meston proposes Critical Indigenous Futurology (CIF) as a framework to reimagine Indigenous education by deliberately shifting from Australian schools toward community-controlled digital learning hubs. He argues that Australia’s racialized socio-technical system suppresses Indigenous digital activism and self-determination, requiring Indigenous communities to develop complex digital capabilities independently. The three-pronged strategy involves extracting essential digital skills from mainstream schools, creating activist-oriented digital disruptors, and establishing community digital learning hubs guided by Elders and knowledge holders. Meston emphasizes that Indigenous learners must acquire racial literacy and advanced technical skills—from cybersecurity to AI development—to participate in digital economies without leaving traditional lands. Drawing on postdigital theory and Indigenous futurisms, he advocates for educational sovereignty that integrates onto-axio-epistemologies with strategic technology deployment. The manifesto positions digital activism as essential for disrupting colonial structures while building Indigenous capacity for technological self-determination through community-centered learning models.

This study conducted a mapping exercise of digital-centric curricular frameworks in Queensland, Australia, focusing on addressing the digital divide affecting Indigenous communities. Using Trans-systemic inquiry and Rhizome methodology, researchers mapped subjects, learning domains, and graduate attributes across school-to-post-school pathways.  The research revealed that while digital-centric curricular pathways exist in Queensland schools, they are insufficient for addressing Indigenous-specific digital exclusion challenges. Indigenous communities face disproportionate barriers to technology access and consistently rank lowest on social welfare indicators, making digital literacy education crucial.  The study identified that schools must play a vital role in developing basic digital literacies and providing technology access. However, existing pathways require enhancement through culturally responsive support mechanisms to effectively serve Indigenous learners.  Four key support mechanisms emerged from the analysis: (1) culturally-attuned practice, (2) age-appropriate education, (3) cultural brokerage, and (4) digital learning factories. The researchers argue that integrating these mechanisms alongside existing rhizomatic curricular pathways would significantly improve digital-centric industry opportunities for Indigenous students.  The findings suggest that addressing the Indigenous digital divide requires more than standard curriculum pathways—it demands culturally informed, comprehensive support systems that acknowledge and respond to the unique challenges faced by Indigenous communities in accessing and engaging with digital technologies.

Simpson advances a theory of Indigenous resurgence grounded in land-based practices and “grounded normativity,” the ethical frameworks generated through place-attached lifeways (grounded normativity defined). She urges a shift from “Indigenizing” state-controlled processes to building Indigenous nationhood that dismantles colonial structures (shift from indigenizing to dismantling). Resurgence centers self-recognition rather than chasing settler validation (self-recognition over recognition), enacted through everyday acts across reserve, rural, and urban lands that collectivize into networks of renewal (everyday acts across all lands; linking individual to collective resurgence). She ties freedom to anticapitalist practices that refuse dispossession and enclosure, insisting “our presence is our weapon” (presence as weapon) and that futures are made by the practices we embody now (futures depend on present practices). The project is a nation-based, relational politics of making—of governance, education, and economy—rooted in land restitution and collective responsibility across generations

DeniseWebb, AngelaMashford-Pringle  Webb and colleagues conducted a rapid review examining how Canadian provincial/territorial ministries of education and post-secondary institutions support non-Indigenous teachers in incorporating Indigenous content into curricula. They found that five provinces and one territory have implemented policies directing Indigenous content integration, with eight jurisdictions providing supportive resources like online tools, templates, and curriculum guidelines. The study identified four themes in teacher preparation: building relationships, challenging personal beliefs, establishing safe spaces, and addressing ongoing obstacles. Despite policy efforts responding to TRC Calls to Action, only 36% of Canadian teachers received formal Indigenous content training, with less than 20% rating their knowledge as strong. The authors highlight risks of culturally unsafe teaching practices when teachers lack adequate preparation, including perpetuating stereotypes or disrespecting traditional knowledge. The research reveals significant gaps between policy intentions and actual teacher readiness, emphasizing the need for enhanced pre-service and in-service training programs.

This book theorizes “digital bundles” as Indigenous Knowledge online grounded in cultural protocols and guided by Elders and Knowledge Keepers. Framed as a decolonial genre, digital bundles function as insider-validated resources that support Indigenous resurgence and nation building when undertaken with care, distinguishing sacred teachings from personal knowledge and educational repositories. Wemigwans’ case of FourDirectionsTeachings.com demonstrates how protocol-rich design, advisory governance, and ceremony confer cultural legitimacy, while also foregrounding custodianship for the next seven generations. The work balances opportunity and risk: online dissemination can empower networks and bottom-up communication, yet raises concerns about commodification, misrepresentation, and the limits of digital media to replace embodied, place-based transmission. Ultimately, A Digital Bundle argues that culturally defined protocols can shape technology to “speak back” to colonial knowledge systems and guide ethical knowledge production, access, and transfer in networked contexts.

In “Supporting Self-Determined Indigenous Innovations: Rethinking the Digital Divide in Canada,” Jasmin Winter and Justine Boudreau argue for the necessity of Indigenous digital self-determination, emphasizing the shift from passive consumption to active innovation with technology. They are critical of colonial narratives that marginalize Indigenous technological agency, and highlight the importance of Indigenous voices in reshaping the discourse around the digital divide. The article explores various attempts to do this, such as digital storytelling and virtual reality projects, that have allowed Indigenous communities to control their technological futures. They cite Jason Lewis (2005) and Michelle Raheja (2010) to illustrate how digital spaces can serve as “virtual reservations,” fostering Indigenous knowledge systems and cultural continuity. The critique extends to Eurocentric diffusionism, which undermines Indigenous contributions to technological progress. Winter and Boudreau advocate for a strength-based approach to technological development, prioritizing community-driven initiatives over top-down interventions. Here they look at programs like Dames Making Games and InSTEM which they feel exemplifies the potential for Indigenous youth to creatively engage with technology. The authors advocate for a holistic view that acknowledges the complex relationship between Indigenous peoples, technology, and the environment and caution against accepting a dichotomy of “real” and “virtual” worlds. Finally they look at a Makerspace project they see as promising for Indigenous innovation as it integrates Indigenous methodologies and worldviews. The TMK project works to connect traditional knowledge with contemporary makerspace theories to enhance community well-being. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for technological development projects to acknowledge colonial legacies and adopt a thoughtful approach to reconciliation.
