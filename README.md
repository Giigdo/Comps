# Digital Media PhD Comprehensive Exam - Prototype Supporting Materials

This repository contains supporting materials for the **prototype component** of my Digital Media PhD Comprehensive Examination at York University.

## Overview

The prototype work explores the development of Indigenous-controlled digital capabilities through accessible technologies, examining the intersection of digital sovereignty, community autonomy, and culturally responsive technological design. This research responds to calls for Indigenous communities to develop technical infrastructure that supports self-determination while maintaining control over knowledge systems.

## Prototypes Explored

The work encompasses five interconnected prototypes:

1. **360Â° Video Pipeline** - Workflow for creating accessible VR-compatible interview content
2. **Spatial Computing** - Community-accessible AR experiences deployable via QR codes and 8th Wall web-based services
3. **Indigenous AI Knowledge Chatbot (AURA)** - Culturally appropriate AI using curated Indigenous scholarship
4. **AI Survey Bot** - Conversational survey tool with data sovereignty considerations
5. **AI Language Bot Testing** - JSON guardrails for culturally appropriate pedagogy using LLMs 

## Repository Contents

- **JSON Scripts** - Prompt engineering files for directing AI behavior with cultural protocols
- **PRT Materials** - Project Reflection Tool prompt and template for Research through Design methodology
- **AR Testing Materials** - QR codes and image targets for spatial computing demonstrations
- **Documentation** - Technical workflows and implementation notes
- **Annotated Bibliography** - Reference associated with intial research for prototype development

## Research Context

This work is grounded in Research through Design methodology and examines the tension between accessibility and sovereignty in digital tool development. The prototypes demonstrate that community-controlled digital capabilities are technically feasible with accessible tools, while also revealing critical questions about data control, infrastructure ownership, and the relationship between ease-of-use and technological sovereignty.

## Documentation

Full prototype documentation, including workflow descriptions, critical insights, and theoretical framing, is available in the comprehensive exam submission.
