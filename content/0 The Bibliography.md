As stated elsewhere in this vault, There is a significant body of work in HCI concerning the design of digital teaching tools and online digital resources to support students learning STEM subjects.  However, despite the amount of prior work in this area, there has been little investigation and/or intentional human-centered technology design/creation to address STEM educational support through a lens of building up Indigenous knowledge, at least in academic journals.

The readings here have been chosen to examine the intersection of STEM pedagogical technologies and Indigenous Knowledge in academia and to start an investigation of the opportunities for community advancement and the transmission of Indigenous knowledge via computational products. The bibliography includes links to the discussion in this site regarding the article as well as the original article itself.
