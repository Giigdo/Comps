The notes on texts and areas of inquiry are linked to outside works and websites, demonstrating the interconnected nature of Indigenous knowledge and digital media. This approach facilitates a more nuanced understanding of the research topic, highlighting the diversity of perspectives and sources that inform this work and making it easy for others to review the sources in the moment and draw their conclusions and make their own connections.

I have done this to make it easier for users to explore the texts that have influenced or supported some of my ideas. I envision these connections fostering a collaborative annotation system for Indigenous-created digital media artifacts, thoughts, writings, and research. Possibly, I could see this leading to a web resource that resembles Wikipedia, but instead of a single authoritative page, it would feature multiple pages written by diverse individuals clearly stating their identities and perspectives. This type of platform would allow for thoughtful, personal, familial, and community-based experiences to illustrate the importance of diverse viewpoints, demonstrating how a single topic can have varying impacts on different groups. I see this particular vault of ideas, built using Obsidian, as an initial seed idea that may grow into something of use primarily to Indigenous people, but useful to all who want to see knowledge through a different point of view.
