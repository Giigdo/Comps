The idea and practice of numbering in this archive has caused me problems - both technical and cultural. In my initial vision of this archive I wanted to have a free flow of connections between pages that a person could wander through. However, in practice there were certain situations where it seemed necessary to follow an order of reading, if only to organize things so that a new visitor could quickly figure out the reason behind the archive. For that reason the menu was organized using a numbered structure that resembles a western academic format. However the numbering is used sparingly in the sections to encourage readers to follow their own path through the materials. I recognize that this might be frustrating for readers who prefer things to be ordered or for other readers who prefer a writer to choose one format or another. No harm was intended and I am sorry if it bothers you. This archive though is organized/not organized for those of us who like some clues as to where to start but, once we get our bearings, prefer to wander and wonder as we see fit in the moment.
