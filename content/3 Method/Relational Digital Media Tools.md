I utilized [Inciteful.xyz](https://inciteful.xyz/) to facilitate initial searches for relevant reading materials for this [[index]] and appreciated its ability to create direct relational connections between papers over immediate and stepped relations. I find this feature resonates with Indigenous methodologies, which emphasize acknowledging relationships and seeing connections through multiple steps of relationality. This approach enables the discovery of ideas not directly connected but linked through secondary, tertiary, or quaternary relationships that give one a sense of how amazing the world actually is. I aim to replicate this architectural connection in my [[index]] by making cross-connections between papers, my own writings, and external resources, such as Indigenous digital media products, communities, and examples. Ultimately, I envision a small, curated archive that illustrates the interconnectedness of ideas from diverse global sources, all centered around Indigenous digital media, education, STEM subjects and demonstrates how they flow and connect in complex ways.
