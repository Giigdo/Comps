This video is a lightning talk from the 54th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education. It takes a look at  Adinkra Indigenous "heritage algorithms" as a basis of improving Black and Indigenous student interest in the principles of computing. The curriculum in question, Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles, looks at designing algorithms and code to solve problems. The process of teaching algorithms by examining Adinkra stamping processes has been used when introducing block based coding to elementary students. In this instance it is now being used with high school teachers to examine their: efficacy in providing rigorous culturally informed education; their understanding of equity and social justice; their ability to integrate this particular algorithm example into their work. Part of the process is to measure teacher starting efficacy with culturally relevant education, then to develop professional development and finally to examine their ability to include cultural practices in their computer science courses.

>The AP CS Framework was created with the intention of broadening participation in computing. This goal requires inquiry into what an intentional shift to being culturally relevant and sustaining requires of teachers

# My Thoughts
- In creating a cultural change for students, teachers need to change their practices - the biggest issue is we do not know precisely what PD practices will support these changes
- There is a need for this type of work across the spectrum of education in urban and rural educational institutions to see what specific shifts are needed in order for Indigenous students to be prepared to study STEM subjects at university and college

# Relation to Larger Theme
- making connections between visible algorithms to improve initial student understanding of the concept has been shown to work with younger students in understanding block coding concepts - it is an interesting idea to reverse the process and see if it can be used to develop teacher understanding of culturally relevant teaching
- The examination of teacher efficacy in applying cultural examples effectively is needed because it has not historically been part of teacher education. One cannot assume that teachers are ready to use these approaches. A clear research process that will look at teacher efficacy and practice after PD is necessary in order to define those training processes that work and can also be scaled up to meet the needs of education in many areas.
