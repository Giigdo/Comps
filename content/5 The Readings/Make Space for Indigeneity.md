Smith argues that decolonizing education requires a shift in the "mind and spirits of educators" to recognize and value diverse worldviews beyond the dominant Western perspective. Current Canadian education systems are rooted in a Eurocentric framework, which has historically taught Indigenous people to distrust their own knowledge systems. Society must value Indigenous knowledge equally to mainstream knowledge, and education systems should foster this ideology. Education for Indigenous peoples should centre on Indigenous ways of knowing, using alternative narratives from the colonized perspective.
Key questions for decolonizing practice in schools that Smith includes are: where does decolonization begin, how can schools be ready for Indigenous students, how can Indigenous voices drive transformation, and what are culturally responsive teaching strategies? Educators must acknowledge and value diverse ways of knowing, moving beyond linear knowledge frameworks. Decolonization requires viewing Indigenous students through a positive perspective. Practical thinking is crucial for educators to support Indigenous students effectively.
Professional development is essential for decolonizing education. Schools need to support Indigenous students by understanding day-to-day practices that can help. Professional learning communities and action-based learning approaches have shown positive outcomes for Indigenous students. This involves ongoing engagement and feedback, not a one-time effort.
Education for Indigenous children must be holistic and inclusive, involving elders, family, and community. Smith argues that inviting elders and knowledge keepers to share oral stories should be as common as using textbooks, though practical challenges exist. Partnerships between education systems and Indigenous communities are essential to avoid further colonization. Decolonization requires resisting ethnocentric thinking and seeking reciprocity, with teacher education and professional development exposing educators to Indigenous methodologies and anti-racist education.

# My Thoughts
  - Professional development that has teachers looking for ways to engage with recent learning of their own has been shown to improve Indigenous student outcomes in Eurocentric systems. We need to be mindful that it takes time to apply new knowledge which can include multiple meetings between teachers and time for feedback. It does not work within a one and done mindset.
  - While engaging with elders is good and indeed necessary, how is this even possible when there are not enough Elder's to match the number of classrooms? Every child should have access to this learning but at the present moment that isn't physically possible. So we must first address what we can do immediately with what tools are currently available to us.
