Jackson 2Bears reflects on the impact of the song "Ten Little Indians" in his early life. He proposes that "technology [is] something alive and filled with spirit" that can be possessed by spirit and continue to affect Indigenous people today. Through his exploration of different recordings of the song, he seeks to understand and remix these cultural memories to create a post-Indian response to the original meaning and use of the song. Using the ideas of Cajete, Jung and Vizenor, 2Bears looks at the effects of colonial archives of the Indian, their effects on him an other Indigenous people in North America, and addresses one way of using audio remix technology to repurpose and oppose those images.

>What I am writing here is a *remix theory*, one that says if we consider technology as something alive and filled with spirit (as some- thing that for us that has a “psychic significance,” and something with which we are interconnected in a “circle of relations”), then these technologies can equally possess spirits that manifest them- selves in the form of ghosts and phantasms — *spectral apparitions whose will, it seems, is to haunt the lives of the living*.

>With this performance series, I wanted to create a new media work that was about what Indigenous philosopher Gerald Vizenor called a post-Indian narrative of *survivance*: “that sensation of a new tribal presence in the very ruins of [the] representations of in- vented Indians.”17 I wanted to make a work that stood against what he called the “colonized *Indian* Other”18 and show the ways in which our people had been displaced, disappeared, and eclipsed by infec- tious codes of colonial mythmaking.

>I see my works as a conversation with spirits and spectres, one that takes place through electronic mediums and new media technologies — they are *spectral conjurations* wherein these ghosts of history are forced to (re)appear so that they might face up to their haunting of the living. 

# My Thoughts
  - I wonder where similar types of spectres exist in western science education and how might we undo these spirits with the inclusion of our own? I wonder if similar digital technological re-mixes of science education's manifest manners might be reworked with Indigenous knowledge. Could Indigenous knowledge be presented by community people alongside settler mythologies and counter long held and often repeated tropes about Indigenous scientific knowledge? 
  - The whole discussion speaks to the purpose of my dissertation, which is to develop methods to be used by community to deal with the spectre that holds Indigenous students back in secondary school study (see [[20-29 York Study/25 Courses/25.02 Directed Reading Vault/5 The Readings/An Emerging Decolonizing Science Education in Canada|An Emerging Decolonizing Science Education in Canada]]). The goal of the dissertation is develop a general means of using available technology so communities can create relevant contextualized education materials for their students in the school boards where they attend science, math and technological courses. 
# Relation to [[5. Indigenous responses to and uses of digital tools]]
  - 2Bears work is a response to earlier media (records) that were used in education to teach counting and maintain colonial depictions of Indigenous people in North America. His particular digital response involved remixing the older tracks into his live DJ performances. The use of archived media in a new digital expression is one example of an Indigenous person building a contemporary response to deal with both contemporary and historical issues of representation.
