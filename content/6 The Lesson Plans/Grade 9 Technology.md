# Lesson Plan Template
## Course: Ontario Grade 9 Technology Course ([TAS1O Technology and the Trades](https://www.dcp.edu.gov.on.ca/en/curriculum/technological-education/courses/tas1o))
## Project:
Design an app for a community group
## Lesson Overview:
In this lesson students will examine an Anishinaabemowin language app and define how it meets the needs of users.
## Curriculum Overall Expectation(s)
A1. Initiating and Planning: demonstrate an understanding of fundamental technological concepts and related skills by initiating and planning projects
A2. Designing and Performing: develop projects that involve creating products and/or services, using a variety of resources and techniques, and record the development of their projects
A3. Analyzing and Refining: evaluate and refine processes, products, and/or services
## Curriculum Specific Expectation(s)
A1.3 investigate and describe design considerations, including accessibility requirements, that are relevant to developing projects involving products and/or services for a specific user or community
A2.2 identify factors that could impact the development of their projects and apply appropriate strategies to increase the probability of a positive outcome
A3.2 analyze the performance of products and/or service delivery using appropriate criteria
## Learning Goal(s) Success Criteria
Students will look at a successful Indigenous language game and list the key elements of the design that make it work. They will use this information to begin development of their own game app.
## Instructional Components and Context
### Student Readiness / Prior Knowledge
Students should have a basic understanding of the engineering design process
Students should be able to document their investigation of existing technology
Students should have decided on a community they will be designing their app for and the need it will meet
### Required Materials
Computer with internet connectivity
https://anishinaabemodaa.app/
Document tool (e.g. Google docs)

**Reading for teacher consideration** [[Sami-digital storytelling]]
## Instructional Process
### Minds On / Instruction
(20 minutes)
Discuss with students the engineering process and land on research as the current task

(see Ontario Ministry of Education, https://www.dcp.edu.gov.on.ca/en/curriculum/technological-education/courses/tas1o/g9-10-program)

Discuss with students what the process of benchmarking is (looking at existing products to identify best practices, gain insights, and improve your own performance)
Show students how to log into the https://anishinaabemodaa.app/
Instruct them to play through rounds of the game and make notes on:
- what it does
- how each page works / how it is designed
- what age group do they think it is for and why
- is it a game or not (they need to be able to explain there logic)
- ask if there are any other relevant questions they might want to ask
### Action
(20 minutes)
Assign students to working / research groups and have them go through the game.
They should be playing through it as a group, not individually, 
They should be making notes as they go to answer the questions you have posed
### Consolidation
(30 minutes)
Groups will present their findings
As a class create a list of what makes a good community centred programming product
Discuss how they might use these benchmarks to support their work on designing an app for their community
Discuss who the game interface is designed for and how the perceived age and culture of the player is made apparent in the design
Remind students they will begin working on their own designs next class
## Assessment and Evaluation
### Conversations
While groups are playing the game prompt them to describe the interface and how it works. Look for students who are thinking from the mind of the designer and support others to consider this point of view. 
### Observations
Watch how groups work and note the roles they are taking on in relation to others. Note strengths and weaknesses for further instructional planning regarding the design process.
### Products
Benchmark notes on game evaluation
