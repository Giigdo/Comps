In my PhD research, I am working to develop materials that exist in straightforward computer environments using HTML, CSS, Markdown and potentially JavaScript or Python. I want to ensure that anything I make is affordable, widely available and reasonably accessible to Indigenous communities, primarily through their students and teachers. 

For that reason I want to use readily accessible computer language and technical tools that a community or school can access without great expense and large learning curve. Therefore, a part of this project will be to develop methodologies that are self-teaching. A large part of the work will involve using oral teaching captured with a 360-degree camera, and creating virtual environments for accessing information individually and in group settings. Some of these environments will demonstrate how these systems are built, maintained, the use of technology involved and the fundamentals of programming.

One idea behind this whole project is to plant a seed for developing a larger ecosystem. Ultimately, I donâ€™t know where it will go, but I want to fill a gap within education and learning in indigenous communities. Currently, there are almost no indigenous people in computer science and engineering programs, and almost none working in high-level academic programming and digital media studies.
