# Lesson Plan Template
## Course: Ontario Grade 9 Geography Course ([CGC1W De-streamed](https://www.dcp.edu.gov.on.ca/en/curriculum/canadian-and-world-studies/courses/cgc1w))
## Unit
Indigenous and non-Indigenous relationships to land and territory
## Lesson Overview:
Students will look at different current online map tools to develop an initial understanding of how they represent different points of view and relationship to lands. This is an initial lesson in a larger unit that looks at how federal, provincial and Indigenous people deal with questions of land, land use and identity.

 Requires access to online map tools: https://native-land.ca/, https://mapcarta.com/Canada, https://mapcarta.com/Ontario 

Different map sources may be used to note how different groups/companies might show or not show information and should become part of the questioning
## Curriculum Overall Expectation(s)
A1. Geographic Inquiry: use the geographic inquiry process and the concepts of geographic thinking when investigating issues relating to Canadian geography

B1. Characteristics of Canada’s Natural Environment and the Impact of Physical Processes describe various characteristics of the natural environment and the spatial distribution of physical features in Canada, and analyze the role of physical processes, phenomena, and events in shaping them
## Curriculum Specific Expectation(s)
A1.2 select and organize relevant data and information on geographic issues from a variety of primary and secondary sources, ensuring that their sources reflect multiple and diverse perspectives

A1.3 apply critical-thinking skills to assess the credibility and biases of relevant sources from a wide variety of media forms, including print, online, and social media as well as content produced using current innovations and technologies, including artificial intelligence

B1.5 explain how various features of Canada’s unique physical geography, including landscapes and landforms, can contribute to Canadian identity, and analyze the significance of the related symbols and images used in Canada and internationally
## Learning Goal(s) Success Criteria
Students will be able to review maps for the information they show and do not show, answer questions about point of view in documentation, formulate new questions for further investigation, document research process
## Instructional Components and Context
### Student Readiness / Prior Knowledge
Students need to know: how to form groups, record information using online documentation tools or by hand, zoom in and move around a virtual / online map
### Required Materials
computers for small group work with access to internet and map resources (check access to maps prior to class)
online documentation tool or access to writing materials

**Reading for teacher consideration** [[Decolonizing geographies of power]]
## Instructional Process
Whole-class instruction
Small group investigation and discussion
Gallery walk
Whole-class discussion
### Minds On / Instruction
(15 minutes)
- Form student groups
- Show map sources for use in the lesson
- Discuss key elements of each map tool
- Present students with following starter questions that they will use for investigation:
	- why might Canadian/Provincial maps not note Indigenous territories, treaties or linguistic relationships?
	- why do Indigenous territories overlap?
	- when you look at the maps for Indigenous territories and Canadian/Provincial maps how are the shapes different? What natural or unnatural things might the borders follow?
	- do the non-Indigenous maps show things like reserves or treaties?
	- borders on the maps note different things - what do they tell you about what is important to the cultures behind each map?
- Give students instruction for activity and then have students start investigation
### Action
(20 minutes)
- Working in small groups, students will compare Indigenous territories on Native-Land.ca to the Provincial and National maps of Canada. 
- Students will work through the opening questions provided by the teacher and as they formulate/ask their own questions, they will record them and their answers.
- Teacher to circulate and have conversations with groups and check for understanding/support process
- Help groups to notice how Indigenous territories might follow different types of land scape, and settler borders tend to follow straight lines (note that curvature of north and south boards is due to projection of the parallel from the globe)

(20 minutes)
- Students will do a [gallery walk](https://www.theteachertoolkit.com/index.php/tool/gallery-walk) at the end of research to see the answers/observations other groups recorded.
### Consolidation
(15 minutes)
- Whole class discussion regarding findings, point of view in resources (maps).
- Unanswered questions will be taken up in **next class** where sources and research question formulation will be taken up.
### Differentiated Instructional Elements
## Assessment and Evaluation
### Conversations
In conversation with each group note who is contributing and if they are developing an understanding of perspective. Look for signs of critical thinking and prompt students to question what makes a resource official or supportable.
### Observations
Watch which students participate and how they participate. Listen into conversations and make note of how critical conversation is carried out. Watch for how students are recording information and support tracking of thoughts using a documentation tool (physical or virtual).
### Products
Documentation of responses to questions, and list of questions for further investigation
