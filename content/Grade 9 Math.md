# Lesson Plan Template
## Course: Ontario Grade 9 Math Course ([MTH1W De-streamed](https://www.dcp.edu.gov.on.ca/en/curriculum/secondary-mathematics/courses/mth1w))
## Challenge:
Applying math concepts to real world problems
## Lesson Overview:
After watching a video of Wigam construction, students will work in small groups to calculate and estimate the amount of materials needed, the potential volume of the structure and other questions about quantities related to the structure.

This lesson is intended to come later in the course as an application / inquiry problem for students. It can be used over several days to review learning in several strands of the math program and be used to consolidate learning from the course.

Be ready to explain what a wigwam is (a traditional lodge structure in Anishinaabe culture) 
## Curriculum Overall Expectation(s)
A2. Making Connections: make connections between mathematics and various knowledge systems, their lived experiences, and various real-life applications of mathematics, including careers
B3. Number Sense and Operations: apply an understanding of rational numbers, ratios, rates, percentages, and proportions, in various mathematical contexts, and to solve problems
E1. Geometric and Measurement Relationships: demonstrate an understanding of the development and use of geometric and measurement relationships, and apply these relationships to solve problems, including problems involving real-life situations
## Curriculum Specific Expectation(s)
B3.4 Applications: solve problems involving operations with positive and negative fractions and mixed numbers, including problems involving formulas, measurements, and linear relations, using technology when appropriate
B3.5 Applications: pose and solve problems involving rates, percentages, and proportions in various contexts, including contexts connected to real-life applications of data, measurement, geometry, linear relations, and financial literacy
E1.3 Geometric and Measurement Relationships: solve problems involving different units within a measurement system and between measurement systems, including those from various cultures or communities, using various representations and technology, when appropriate
E1.6 Geometric and Measurement Relationships solve problems using the relationships between the volume of prisms and pyramids and between the volume of cylinders and cones, involving various units of measure
## Learning Goal(s) Success Criteria
Students will be able to use skills of calculation, estimation and understanding of proportions to figure out how much material has been collected and is required to build a community wigwam. Students will be able to explain their reasoning using math concepts and skills from the course.
## Instructional Components and Context
Problem-Solving Tasks and Experiences
Teaching about Problem Solving
Deliberate Practice
Math Conversations
### Student Readiness / Prior Knowledge
Students should have:
- encountered proportional reasoning
- performed calculations using mixed numbers in generalized problem solving
### Required Materials
Exploring Math Through the Construction of a Lodge Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHGi8YXqS7w
Paper and pencil to draw models and calculate volume, area and mass of birch bark
(potential) straws for building scale model of structural supports

## Instructional Process
### Minds On / Instruction
Watch video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHGi8YXqS7w
Think-pair share question 
- how did the builders decide on the amount of bark to gather and what were the initial numbers they used for measurements?
- is it possible to calculate how much birch bark is needed? 
- What mathematical tool would you use to come up with the answer?
Give students the task questions to answer and support group formation
Give students the link to the video for review if needed
### Action
Working in small groups calculate/estimate the following:
- How much area the initial birch bark collected would cover and estimate how much is still needed to complete the work?
- Calculate/estimate the possible volume of a building covered by that much material
- Calculate/estimate how many people might be able to sit or stand in that building at one time
- Could you calculate the approximate weight of the birch bark that the building is holding up?
- What numbers do you need to come up with the answers?
### Consolidation
Have groups share their responses and explain their reasoning
Take whole class through a process you might use to solve the problems (refer back to past lessons) and discuss the fuzzy logic problem associated with the overlap of sheets of birchbark

Question for over-night thinking: if you were part of the planning group, what extra percentage of material do you think would be reasonable to gather OR what percentage less material would you gather and why? (looking for reasoning related to waste, sustainability and care for the trees - note that properly collected bark does not harm the tree, but it can only be collected once from each tree)
## Further Advancement of Learning
Have students create an algebraic expression of the exterior size of the wigwam to calculate volume and then use that expression to calculate the size of a smaller building suitable for a single family. 
## Assessment and Evaluation
### Conversations
Circulate through groups and discuss their reasoning/calculation processes. Develop a sense of how each student is contributing. Demonstrate, when needed, how they might use paper and pencil or scale models to support their processes.
### Observations
Watch how each group is working through problems and note strengths and areas of support for each student.
### Products
Paper calculations, scale model (if used), presentation of ideas
