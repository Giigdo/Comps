# Lesson Plan Template
## Course: Ontario Grade 9 Science Course ([SNC1D de-streamed](https://www.dcp.edu.gov.on.ca/en/curriculum/secondary-science/courses/snc1w))
## Unit:
How we affect our environment
## Lesson Overview:
Students will look at how the use of fire can benefit natural environments and are part of natural cycles.
## Curriculum Overall Expectation(s)
Biology: B1 Relating Science to Our Changing World, B2 Investigating and Understanding Concepts

Chemistry: C2 Investigating and Understanding Concepts
## Curriculum Specific Expectation(s)
B1.3 investigate and explain how sustainable practices used by various communities, including First Nations, Métis, and Inuit communities, reflect an understanding of the importance of the dynamic equilibrium of ecosystems

B2.2 explain how naturally occurring phenomena, including the cycling of matter and the flow of energy, contribute to the dynamic equilibrium within and between ecosystems

B2.5  explain the effects of various human activities on the dynamic equilibrium of ecosystems

C2.1 investigate properties, changes, and interactions of matter that are important for the dynamic equilibrium of ecosystems and their sustainability
## Learning Goal(s) Success Criteria
Students will be able to describe the beneficial effects of a controlled burn on a forested area and explain its historical use or lack of use in an area.
## Instructional Components and Context
### Student Readiness / Prior Knowledge
Students should understand how to read through materials and make notes to answer a specific question
Students should understand the basic premise of natural cycles in the environment 
### Required Materials
Indigenous Fire Practices Shape our Land https://www.nps.gov/subjects/fire/indigenous-fire-practices-shape-our-land.htm
Indigenous Peoples Burning Network https://firenetworks.org/ipbn/

## Instructional Process
### Minds On / Instruction
- Discuss with students how fire works at the chemical level and what its role might be in ecosystems. 
- Play video of A Conversation With Fire Keepers https://prescribedfire.ca/cultural-burning/ 
### Action
Divide students into small groups and assign each group a different aspect of controlled burns and give them access to online materials to support research:
- Indigenous Fire Practices Shape our Land https://www.nps.gov/subjects/fire/indigenous-fire-practices-shape-our-land.htm
- Cultural Burning and Prescribed Fire https://prescribedfire.ca/cultural-burning/
- Indigenous communities turn to prescribed burns to protect land from wildfires https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/indigenous-communities-turn-to-prescribed-burns-to-protect-land-from-wildfires-1.7187630

**Research Groups**
- benefits to plant growth, 
- prevention of larger wildfires, 
- impact on animal habitats
- impact on forestry industry
- impact on local communities
### Consolidation
Have groups present their findings and highlight social and scientific ideas as they are brought up
Discuss with students what are the concerns with doing and not doing controlled burns. 
Discuss how wildfires start naturally without human intervention and the danger they pose
## Assessment and Evaluation
### Conversations
Check in with groups as they do their investigations and support them in pulling relevant information from resources. Engage students in discussions that bring them back to the opening discussion about how fire works at the chemical and level and what it can mean for biological cycles (i.e. carbon cycle)
### Observations
Watch how groups engage with video and reading materials and support each other. Listen for the use of scientific concepts taught in previous classes and discussed at the beginning of the class.
### Products
Notes and presentation of materials during consolidation activity.
