The existence of generative AI tools is proving interesting at this stage in the development of many processes including Indigenous research. There have been meetings and conferences devoted to Indigenous visioning of AI (see [Abundant Intelligences](https://www.indigenous-ai.net/abundant/) for one instance). There are also very valid concerns that the current development of AI tools are happening in spheres influenced by the corporate world and academia that have traditionally not been supportive of Indigenous peoples or their interests. However, the idea that you can have a conversation with an AI assistant as a way of working with technology is similar to oral Indigenous methodologies and makes for intriguing research and development of HCI tools. For that reason I'm trying out using AI to help me work through my thoughts in addition to my conversations with mentors, friends, family and just about anybody who will listen to me as I work on this and other projects. One thing that I find AI tools (generative chat bots at least, see [there are many types of AI in existence](https://practicalai.fm/285)) are very good at is helping me to examine my initial ideas through a critical eye that is non-judgmental. I also find it interesting to see that AI can mimic the very natural protocol of sitting and having tea with someone, which is very much a model of Indigenous research processes.
