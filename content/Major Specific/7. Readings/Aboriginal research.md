# Summary
This important article by Absolon and Willett is an important summary of the elements that define Indigenous research. They argue that research methods specific to Indigenous people need approaches that are different for those found in most Euro-western research methods. The article explores the historical effects of Western methods applied to Indigenous peoples and their culture. Absolon and Willett make it clear that research design and knowledge creation that is unaware or deliberately ignorant of its affect on Indigenous people will not maintain Indigenous knowledges which should be the goal of research for Indigenous people.
