# Summary

Meagan Byrne argues in this online article that video games created by Indigenous people can create digital spaces that are safe for Indigenous knowledge storage and transmission. The ability to work with storytelling methods are deeply connected to Indigenous cultures and give Native creators a place to explore trauma and identity in an effort to share experience and sharing healing journeys. Because games are read only they can preserve the knowledge that is embedded in them for community members to experience in diverse physical and temporal locations.
