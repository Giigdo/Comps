To facilitate this research, I employed a non-linear, connected approach using [Inciteful.xyz](https://Inciteful.xyz) as a platform for organization and analysis. This method allowed me to find relationships between ideas, notes, and sources, mirroring the interconnected nature of Indigenous knowledge systems. I have tried to set up this vault in a similar way, making connections between articles. This is not as free form as I would like it to be though. The links are the ones that I have made and as such the vault as a whole is an archive of my thinking on these subjects at the time of publishing. While it is not a straightforward linear representation of my thinking, it is made of connecting linear segments that represent my personal web of thoughts in relation to HCI subjects and Indigenous Digital Media.
