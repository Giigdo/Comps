This chapter looks at a long-term research and education project conducted by Jo-Ann Archibald regarding the development of a culturally responsive math program. The project called Transformative Education for Aboriginal Mathematics - Learning (TEAM-Learning) is conducted with a rural Indigenous community in British Columbia and involved teachers working with community elders and expert community members. It explores how Indigenous storywork, that is teaching concepts through traditional stories, has helped researchers and teachers develop and sustain their roles and relationships to each other, students, families, community, Indigenous knowledge, and mathematics. A great deal of focus is on these relationships and how they are important to the overall process. An enduring result of the article is the The 4 Rs of storywork proposed by Archibald, which are respect, responsibility, reverence and reciprocity. These have supported much conversation and been expanded on by other Indigenous education scholars.

>Indigenous storywork methodology that we have acquired from interviews with community members and teachers and from our reflections: (1) establishing relationships through protocol, visiting, listening, and “being there”; (2) learning from each other through sharing personal teaching stories and mentoring; and (3) learning about Indigenous knowledges through experiencing Indigenous stories.

>Teachers’ knowledge and understanding of culturally responsive pedagogy improved through their TEAM-Learning experiences. The storywork principles of holism, interrelatedness, and synergy helped them explore and share their evolving understandings in the regularly sched- uled group meetings.

# My Thoughts
  - Archibald points out the connection between knowledge and community is important as in many Indigenous contexts, what we choose to teach our children and use as adults, is about survival. We are not currently focused on exploitation of resources or dominance over the world, which in many ways incommensurate with Indigenous ways of being. Because of this, there is an inherent questioning of what we should do measured against the effects our actions will have on the rest of the world. (See Little bear and Cajete).
  - Stories can teach more than just moral values and entertain. They can be used to teach science as well. The digital medium is a good place for both story telling and also distributing the materials to support student learning at school and home.

# Relation to [[2. Transforming educational practice]]
- The issue for educating Indigenous students as Archibald points out is both elucidating and including a Indigenous philosophy and for teachers to recognize the abilities of First Nations students and help them hone those skills.
- The 4 Rs that Archibald discusses have become integrated in many Indigenous methodologies. They further connect to methodology of Hupfield that is Nishnaabe specific and Simpson's radical resurgence work.
