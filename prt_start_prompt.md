# PRT Documentation Initiation Prompt

Use the following text to begin a PRT (Project Reflection Tool) documentation session after completing design or research work:

---

"I've just completed a design/research activity and would like to document it using our PRT Conversational Analysis process. I'm ready to reflect on this work and capture the key information following Dalsgaard and Halskov's documentation structure. Can you guide me through our template questions to help me create comprehensive documentation of this activity? After our conversation, please create a markdown artifact that I can download, with the title following this format: 'YYYY-MM-DD - [Brief descriptor of activity]' based on our conversation."

---

This prompt will initiate a guided reflective conversation based on the PRT template structure. At the end of the conversation, an artifact will be generated with properly formatted documentation that follows the Dalsgaard and Halskov framework.
