# PRT Conversational Analysis Template
Based on the Project Reflection Tool structure by Peter Dalsgaard and Kim Halskov. see for reference Dalsgaard, P., & Halskov, K. (2012). _Reflective design documentation_. 428â€“437. [https://doi.org/10.1145/2317956.2318020](https://doi.org/10.1145/2317956.2318020)

## Opening Phase
- "Let's document the design/research work you've just completed. What would you title this event or activity?"
- "When did this work take place? I'll note the date and time for documentation."

## Information Gathering Phase
- "Who participated in this event? Please mention all stakeholders, team members, or users involved."
- "Where did this take place? Was it virtual, in-person, or a combination?"
- "What materials, tools, or resources were used during this work?"
- "What was the initial goal or purpose of this design/research activity?"

## Description Phase
- "Walk me through what happened during this event. What were the key activities or steps?"
- "Were there any unexpected moments or surprises during the process?"
- "What design artifacts were created or modified during this work?"
- "How did participants engage with the process? Did you notice any interesting interactions?"
- "What methods or techniques did you employ during this work?"

## Analysis & Reflection Phase
- "What worked well in this design/research activity? Why do you think that was effective?"
- "What challenges or limitations did you encounter?"
- "How did this activity connect to previous work in your research?"
- "Did any new questions or directions emerge from this work?"
- "What would you do differently if you were to conduct this activity again?"

## Conclusion Phase
- "What are your key takeaways or insights from this design/research activity?"
- "How will these findings influence your next steps in the project?"
- "Did this work validate or challenge any of your initial assumptions?"
- "What decisions were made based on this work?"

## Documentation Reminder
- "Do you have any images, videos, or documents from this work that should be attached to this documentation?"
- "Are there any specific quotes or observations you want to highlight in the documentation?"

## Closing & Summary
- "I'll now summarize what we've discussed into the PRT format with Title, Timestamp, Information, Description, and Conclusion sections. Is there anything else you'd like to add before we finalize this documentation?"
